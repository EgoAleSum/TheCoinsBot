**TheCoinsBot Privacy**

Note: TheCoinsBot source code is fully open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/EgoAleSum/TheCoinsBot), so you can observe how the bot works internally.

TheCoinsBot only collects information that is sent to it via direct messages and does not have access to past or archived messages. All messages sent between TheCoinsBot and the Telegram platform are transmitted over an encrypted connection (using SSL).

When users interact with TheCoinsBot, it receives basic user information from the Telegram platform (trasmitted on an encrypted channel using SSL): this includes your Telegram user id and username, and your full name. With the exception of the Telegra user id, all other user information is ignored by the bot: TheCoinsBot does never process or store your name or Telegram username.

In order to improve the product, TheCoinsBot stores telemetry information including the text of messages sent to it, as well as the Telegram user id of the sender. Telemetry data is stored on text files on the servers that power the bot.

TheCoinsBot does not transmit any personally identifiable information that it stores (including your Telegram user id) to third parties.
